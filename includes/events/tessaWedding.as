Two clusters of chairs, separated by a long carpeted aisle with a small stage on the end. What you didn’t expect was just how many humans were in the room. At a rough count you estimate there to be around eighty people so far, and out of the pack you only see a handful of other races.

Well she might have had less friends than I did. She’s a snake.

Few of us didn’t. It was the four of us for a couple years. Karen, Jan, Adra and... Oh you’ve got to be fucking joking.”</i> Tessa’s gaze stops on the stage towards the end of the room, fixated on a statuesque tall blonde man.");

While you had certainly seen bigger people during your time adventuring, this man is certainly still impressive. He is at least 6’6 from what you can tell, and his suit seems filled out and almost stretched by more than a little muscle. The man oozes swagger, seemingly at perfect ease in the moment and more than a few lusty looks are aimed his way. Between his blonde locks and his impressive build, the man seems almost a male model.

Fine. That’s Clark. Monty’s cousin.”</i> Tessa’s gaze returns to the tall man. <i>“I knew he would be here, I’m just surprised he’s the Best Man.”</i>");
